git config --global credential.helper cache
git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600"

# Since Git 1.7.9 (released in late January 2012), there is a neat
# mechanism in Git to avoid having to type your password all the time
# for HTTP / HTTPS, called credential helpers.

git config --global credential.helper cache

# Tell Git to keep your password cached in memory.
# Default is 15 minutes.

# You can set a longer timeout with:
git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600"


# GitHub's help also suggests that if you're on Mac OS X and used
# Homebrew to install Git, you can use the native Mac OS X keystore:
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

For Windows, there is a helper called Git Credential Manager for Windows or wincred in msysgit.

git config --global credential.helper wincred # obsolete

With Git for Windows 2.7.3+ (March 2016):

git config --global credential.helper manager

For Linux, you can use gnome-keyring(or other keyring implementation such as KWallet).
