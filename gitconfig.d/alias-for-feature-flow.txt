##
# Git aliases suitable for features.
#
# These aliases are simple starting points for a simple feature flow.
# You can adjust these as you like, to suit your project and/or team.
#
##

##
# Create a new feature branch:
#
#   1. Update the master branch
#   2. Create a new branch with your feature name and based on the master branch
#
# Example:
#
#     git feature-start my-idea-here
#
# If you use any kind of testing framework, or test driven development,
# the it is wise to test your feature immediately after running this,
# to ensure that your branch starts with all the tests succeeding.
##

git feature-start = '!branch=$1; git checkout master; git pull; git checkout -b "$branch" master'

##
# Update the feature branch:
#
#   1. Update the master branch
#   2. Update the feature branch with any changes from the master branch
#
# Example:
#
#     git feature-update
#
# If you use any kind of testing framework, or test driven development,
# the it is wise to test your feature immediately after running this,
# to ensure that any available updates are successfully integrated.
##

git feature-update = '!branch=$(git branch-name); git checkout master; git pull; git checkout "$branch"; git rebase master'

##
# Share the feature branch:
#
#   1. Push the feature branch to the origin.
#   2. Set the upstream tracking.
#
# Example:
#
#     git feature-share
#
# If you use a sharing site such a GitHub, then this command
# will make your branch visible to your project collaborators.
# Many teams share branches before they are fully ready, to help
# the team provide feedback on the work-in-progress.
##

git feature-share = '!branch=$(git branch-name); git push -u origin "$branch"'
